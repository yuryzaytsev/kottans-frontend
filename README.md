Notes and course progress.

## Git Basics

#### Reflections:

I always use Git in my daily work. But these courses refreshed my knowledge and improved my skills in some points.

- [Linux Survival (3 module)](task_linux_cli/screenshot_3.png?raw=true)
- [Linux Survival (4 module)](task_linux_cli/screenshot_4.png?raw=true)

#### Reflections:

- **Linux Survival**: I have experience working with Linux â€” used Fedora as a second OS. The first module was a bit easy for me. Other modules were more interesting. I memorized the file security principle. Understood how useful can be `cat`, `grep` commands and other while using pipe output. 
- **HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know**: I have basic knowledge about HTTP Protocol, but in the second part of the article I found new information for me.

#### Reflections: 

- **GitHub & Collaboration**: I refreshed my existing knowledge about Git and learned `git rebase` command. 
- **Learn Git Branching**: cool interactive exercises for practicing Git. I got a lot of knowledge about Git remotes commands.
